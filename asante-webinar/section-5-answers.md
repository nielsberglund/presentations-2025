Q: What will customer experience look like in the next 3–5 years as predictive AI and real-time data become the norm?

A: In the next 3–5 years, customer experience shifts from reactive to *anticipatory*: predictive AI and real-time data will drive hyper-personalized “next best experiences” at every touchpoint, proactively solving issues before customers even notice them and orchestrating seamless journeys across channels—something already linked to up to **40% more revenue** for highly personalized retailers. 

Under the hood, real-time CDPs and agentic AI will become standard (with over **70% of companies doubling down on first-party data and 84% using real-time activation**), while humans focus on complex, high-empathy interactions—crucial in a world where **59% of CX leaders** expect AI-powered CX to boost loyalty and lifetime value.

Q: If a company wants to start enhancing their customer experience using technology today, what is the single smartest first step?

A: The single smartest first step *isn’t* buying a new AI tool or CDP—it’s getting to the **truth** of your customer experience: audit where all your customer data lives, break down silos, and map the *real* end-to-end journey from the customer’s point of view, not the PowerPoint fantasy. 

That combination of unified data and honest journey mapping becomes your north star, surfacing the biggest friction points, aligning teams (over 80% of practitioners say it does), and, as in Bose’s case, unlocking gains like **20% higher online conversions** and **15% fewer support calls** *before* you buy anything. Only after 6–8 weeks of this groundwork should you choose technology—so every rand you spend is tied to a specific, proven problem rather than a shiny AI gamble.

Q:  What advice would you give to teams looking to unify their MarTech, AI, and data strategies?

A: To really unify MarTech, AI, and data, you start with **data and outcomes, not tools**: fix silos (now cited by 68% of orgs as the top concern), build a solid data foundation and semantic layer, and get leadership plus cross-functional teams (CMO, CIO, CFO, IT, marketing) truly aligned around growth, not shiny features. 

Then you move to **composable, API-friendly architecture** with regular stack audits (most firms now use only about a third of their MarTech capabilities), strict governance and consent-by-design, and “minimum viable” integrations that connect identifiers and key events across systems—always keeping humans in the loop so AI stays aligned with brand, ethics, and regulation.
