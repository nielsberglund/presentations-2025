## The Fundamental Shift: From Executor to Orchestrator

Unlike traditional AI tools that require constant human input, agentic AI systems work autonomously—launching campaigns, optimizing customer journeys, and making strategic decisions without continuous oversight. For marketers, this shift demands an entirely new skill set focused on orchestration, ethics, and strategic thinking.

This transformation elevates marketers from tactical executors to strategic commanders, requiring mastery of distinctly human capabilities that AI cannot replicate.

The research is unanimous: the nature of marketing and CX work is fundamentally changing.

The World Economic Forum published the Future of Jobs Report in January 2025, highlighting that 77% of surveyed employers recognize the need for reskilling and upskilling their workforce through 2030 to foster effective collaboration with AI.

According to the World Economic Forum, 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025 to keep pace with technological advancements.

## The Two Skill Categories: Technical Fluency + Human Capabilities

The future requires a hybrid professional who excels at both.

### Category 1: Technical and AI Skills

#### 1. AI Literacy and Fluency

While 86% of leaders still rank data literacy as essential for day-to-day work, a growing 69% say the same for AI literacy—a significant 7-point increase from last year. In fact, when asked to identify the fastest-growing skills needed on their teams, AI literacy now matches business intelligence at the top of the list.

According to LinkedIn's 2024 Work Change Report, the share of job posts mentioning AI has nearly doubled in just two years. Professionals in marketing, software development, finance, healthcare, and HR are increasingly expected to understand and interact with AI tools.

**What AI literacy actually means:**

AI isn't the answer to every challenge—you must know when to use it. AI shines with repetitive, time-consuming, or data-heavy tasks, helping you work faster and smarter. But for creative thinking or complex decisions, people are still the experts. When you understand what AI is good at (and what it's not), you can let it take care of the busy work, giving your team more time to focus on higher-level work.

AI literacy empowers employees to select the appropriate tools and utilize them effectively. Understanding AI's strengths and limits is essential for solving problems, anticipating needs and making informed strategic decisions.

#### 2. Prompt Engineering

This has emerged as a critical skill for marketing professionals:

AI prompt engineering—creating and refining inputs for AI systems—is one of the most important emerging skills for marketers. Marketers who understand AI will be able to use it for tasks such as: Data analysis: Automating data collection, interpretation, and report generation. Idea generation and content creation: Using AI tools to brainstorm campaign ideas, create outlines, and even generate content.

The highest ROI comes from teams skilled in AI prompt engineering, holistic campaign planning, and understanding how to merge human strategic thinking with machine efficiency.

Prompt engineering enables students to modify tone, adjust relevance, and enhance creativity, capabilities that are vital for producing personalized content and fostering meaningful customer interactions.

Prompt engineering isn't just a technical skill, it was a storytelling skill too. You're literally standing at the interface between how humans think and how machines respond. And if you can master this layer, you become 10x more effective in any tech-enabled field.

#### 3. Data Literacy and Analytics

Being data-literate simply means understanding the basics of how data is structured and how it's used. AI systems rely heavily on data for training, analysis, and decision-making, so understanding how data works is crucial to use and interpret AI outputs.

Data and AI literacy are deeply intertwined. Without a strong foundation in data—governance, interpretation, and analytical thinking—AI adoption risks becoming a surface-level trend.

For marketers to remain competitive, they should pursue more sophisticated skills, including algorithmic literacy to understand how AI systems make decisions, data architecture expertise to ensure these systems receive appropriate inputs.

#### 4. Data Storytelling

Raw data isn't enough—the ability to translate insights into action is crucial:

Let's face it—numbers alone don't move people. It's the story behind the numbers that sparks decisions and drives action. That's where Storytelling with Data becomes a must-have skill for marketers. Imagine turning dry statistics into a narrative so compelling that it not only captures attention but also inspires stakeholders to take action.

Data storytelling is crucial. It's about translating numbers and analytics into a narrative that everyone, even those without a technical background, can grasp. This skill helps marketers communicate results and strategies more effectively.

#### 5. Technical Tool Proficiency

In our Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report 2025, we found that 86 percent of CX leaders believe AI will completely transform customer experience within the next three years. Developing tech proficiency is now vital to strengthening agents' customer service skills, enabling them to stay competitive.

---

### Category 2: Uniquely Human Skills (What AI Cannot Replicate)

This is where the research is emphatic—soft skills are becoming the new hard skills.

A recent study shows that 92% of hiring managers now consider soft skills equally, if not more, important than technical expertise.

Soft skills have experienced 138% growth in demand since 2021, with collaborative problem-solving, adaptability, and strategic thinking becoming as valuable as technical capabilities.

#### 1. Strategic Thinking

Human-only responsibilities: Brand strategy, ethical oversight, creative storytelling, relationship building. Human-AI partnership zones: Content ideation, campaign conceptualization, performance analysis. AI-autonomous domains: A/B testing, bid optimization, audience targeting, reporting generation.

What separates exceptional digital marketers from average ones isn't just knowledge of individual tactics but the ability to integrate these skills into cohesive strategies that drive measurable business outcomes. As AI and automation handle more routine tasks, the most valuable marketers will be those who can provide the strategic direction, creative insights, and human judgment that technology cannot replicate.

#### 2. Creativity and Innovation

AI can generate content, analyze data, and even make basic decisions, but it cannot originate truly creative ideas, build trusted relationships, or navigate ambiguous situations with human nuance. Traits like originality, emotional intelligence, ethical judgment, and cultural understanding remain exclusive to people.

Artificial intelligence can do almost anything, right? Write, code, manage schedules… But let's pause for a moment to consider what machines cannot do: invent without predefined rules, dream without limits, or connect seemingly unrelated ideas to create unexpected solutions.

While AI can generate content or mimic art, it lacks genuine creativity—the ability to innovate, imagine, and connect abstract ideas. Artists, designers, and entrepreneurs combine emotion, intuition, and personal experience—things machines can't replicate. Human imagination fuels every creative breakthrough, from product design to storytelling.

#### 3. Critical Thinking and Judgment

What's missing in today's workforce is not raw intelligence, but judgment—the ability to question AI-generated outputs, spot biases, and make sound decisions.

AI can analyze data, but human judgment is needed to interpret results, ask the right questions, and make complex decisions. Critical thinking involves evaluating information objectively, identifying biases (even those in AI outputs), and reasoning through uncertainty.

Ethical judgment to navigate questions of privacy and manipulation, and perhaps most critically, the ability to identify the boundaries where human judgment should supersede algorithmic recommendations.

#### 4. Emotional Intelligence and Empathy

High emotional intelligence allows employees to connect and build trust with customers through empathy and rapport, which AI cannot replicate, enhancing loyalty and satisfaction.

In the near term, skills such as conflict resolution and design thinking will remain valuable much as they are today because they rely on creativity, contextual understanding, and empathy—qualities that machines cannot yet replicate at a high level.

One of the most important customer service skills, empathy, is essential in building customer relationships and de-escalating high-tension situations. A customer service agent must have the emotional intelligence to empathize with upset customers, collaborate with them, and work to find a solution.

#### 5. Adaptability and Learning Agility

Technical skills evolution includes mastery of Google Analytics 4, advanced SEO techniques, social media management across multiple platforms, and AI tool integration. However, the specific tools change rapidly, making learning agility more important than expertise in any single technology.

The digital marketing landscape changes so rapidly that the ability to adapt and learn continuously is perhaps the most valuable meta-skill a professional can develop. Professionals who thrive in digital marketing commit to ongoing education through courses, certifications, industry publications, and hands-on experimentation.

In a world where technology can automate almost everything, humanity's ability to imagine the unimaginable will be a critical advantage. Companies that tap into this invaluable resource will gain a competitive edge—not by mastering digital tools better than their competitors, but by using those tools to support truly novel ideas.

#### 6. Authentic Storytelling

In a world where everything is a ChatGPT prompt away, creating content isn't nearly as valuable. You can't create hundreds of pages of 'unique' content and hope to rank well. Instead, people will be drawn to others that deliver an authentic narrative. The best way to do that is wrap everything in a story. Humans are hardwired to love a good story.

Great marketers are also great storytellers. In 2025, this skill goes beyond writing—it includes creating engaging video content, podcasts, and interactive media. Storytelling connects with audiences on an emotional level, increasing brand loyalty and conversion rates.

Focus on uniquely human value—Use AI to eliminate busywork while doubling down on relationship building, creative storytelling, and strategic thinking that only humans can provide.

#### 7. Ethical Judgment and AI Governance

AI systems are built by humans and are influenced by the biases and moral perspectives of their creators. This means you have to rely on your own ethical judgment to determine whether something is appropriate or responsible to move forward with. As AI becomes widespread, understanding its ethical implications is essential. You'll need to make real-time decisions about when, where, and how to use it responsibly.

A PwC survey found that 85% of CEOs view AI ethics as a critical concern, yet only 25% have implemented frameworks to address it.

## The Human-AI Collaboration Model

Major new technologies have always changed how people work—and artificial intelligence may be the most powerful yet. Many worry this means mass job losses. Our research suggests something more nuanced—and ultimately more hopeful. AI, in its current form, works best in collaboration with people, not in place of them.

It combines AI's speed, data processing, and automation with human creativity, critical thinking, empathy, and judgment, leading to superior outcomes and increased productivity.

Evaluating both human and AI capabilities will enable organizations to determine where AI excels—in areas such as automating repetitive, data-heavy tasks—and where human skills like creativity and judgment are mission critical to maintain.

**Practical collaboration looks like this:**

Take problem-solving—spotting issues and then finding solutions. Agents and robots can drill into data sets to identify patterns and generate options. But it is up to people to interpret those findings and decide what to do. In customer relations, for example, agents and robots can handle routine queries, freeing people to focus on building stronger relationships.

## CX-Specific Skills for the Future

Explore and practice with tools like AI chatbots, macros, and automation settings. Stay current on CX tech trends and share insights with your team. Lead short peer training sessions on tool best practices. Digital literacy requires technical and cognitive skills to find, access, and respond to online-based queries.

Inquisitive and compassionate agents who use inclusive language are viewed as honest, trustworthy, and reliable, significantly impacting customer satisfaction and loyalty. Service reps who ask questions, refrain from passing judgment, and consider multiple viewpoints before making decisions are irreplaceable.

A creative and resourceful agent typically takes a classic service interaction from forgettable to memorable. Asking unique but relevant questions, referencing customer interests, presenting out-of-the-box solutions, or offering discounts can delight customers and improve interactions.

---

## Skills That Are Declining in Value

The research also identifies what's becoming less valuable:

Traditional market researchers and marketing data analysts have arguably seen the most disruption from AI. Where these professionals were previously responsible for collecting and analyzing large data sets, LLMs can perform the same task exponentially faster than humans.

Marketing professionals report that pure technical ad management skills are becoming less valuable than strategic insight and data interpretation abilities.

---

## The Leadership Imperative

Companies are increasingly prioritizing skills such as technological literacy; creative thinking; and knowledge of AI, big data and cybersecurity. AI will redefine productivity, emphasizing human-machine collaboration, wellbeing, and the creation of new knowledge and experiences.

Leadership Development Will Focus on Emotional Agility. Organizations will increasingly focus on developing leadership skills that emphasize emotional agility, which enables leaders to handle both positive and negative situations with resilience and adaptability. Leaders who can demonstrate emotional agility will be the ones who inspire high-performing teams and successfully manage change.

AI-Augmented Collaboration: Working alongside AI systems in hybrid teams. Change Leadership: Guiding peers through digital transformation. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence: Maintaining trust in customer and employee interactions.

## The Investment Gap

Organizations aren't moving fast enough:

46% of leaders now report having a mature, organization-wide data literacy program, up from 35% last year. AI training has seen even greater growth—43% of organizations now offer mature AI upskilling, nearly doubling from 25% in 2024.

But challenges remain:

Budget constraints, employee resistance, lack of executive support, and difficulty measuring ROI continue to stall progress. Many leaders also cite a lack of interactivity and personalization in existing training resources, making it harder to drive real engagement and skill retention.

The Deloitte 2025 Human Capital Trends report warns that organizations are underinvesting in the social skills required for AI-driven teamwork.

## Practical Recommendations for Organizations

Start with strategic clarity—Define clear business objectives and success metrics before implementing any AI agents. Agentic systems amplify strategy, so poor strategy leads to amplified failure. Experiment rapidly but systematically—Test AI agent capabilities in controlled environments before full deployment. Maintain human oversight—Even autonomous systems require human strategic guidance, ethical monitoring, and creative input.

**For team development:**

Creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, communication, adaptability, leadership, and collaboration are essential human skills that augment AI capabilities. By integrating soft skills into training, hiring for attitude and potential, fostering continuous learning, demonstrating empathetic leadership, and redesigning jobs to emphasize human-centered tasks.

Organizations should invest in training programs to foster a culture of continuous learning, enabling their workforce to adapt to emerging tools and roles. A Gartner study predicts that by 2026, 75% of large enterprises will have formalized data literacy programs to upskill employees.

## The Bottom Line

The future belongs to hybrid thinkers—individuals who combine technical fluency, human judgment, and strategic imagination. These are no longer skills of tomorrow. They are the currency of relevance today, shaping whether organizations merely adopt AI or truly advance with it.

Closing the AI skills gap is not about teaching tools. It is about elevating human potential.

The combination of technological proficiency and human insight will define the leaders of tomorrow. The future of work is not about humans versus machines—it's about humans enhanced by machines.

The organizations that will thrive in the AI-powered CX future are those investing now in both technical AI capabilities AND the uniquely human skills that make technology meaningful. The winners won't be the most automated—they'll be the most thoughtfully augmented.
