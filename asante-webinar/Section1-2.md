@: In your experience, what are the top three most common issues you find in a company's data architecture that immediately bottleneck their AI and personalization efforts?

Great question—this gets to the practical realities that derail so many MarTech initiatives. Let me research the most common patterns.This is where the rubber meets the road for your webinar audience. Based on what I've seen across the industry research, here are the three most common data architecture issues that immediately bottleneck AI and personalization efforts:

## 1. Data Silos — The "Invisible Walls" Problem

This is far and away the most pervasive issue. According to CMSWire's 2025 State of Digital Customer Experience report, 28% of businesses cite "siloed systems, technology integration challenges and/or fragmented customer data" as a top-three barrier—nearly as significant as budget constraints.

The numbers are stark: In a recent industry survey, 81% of IT leaders said data silos are hindering their digital transformation efforts. Because successful AI depends on integrated data, an overwhelming 95% of IT leaders reported that integration challenges are impeding AI adoption in their organizations.

**What this looks like in practice:**
- Fragmented customer data across sales, marketing and service departments hinders personalized experience delivery. Teams working with inconsistent data cannot effectively share customer preferences, interaction histories and service information.
- The marketing department using a separate CRM system from the sales team. The finance department maintaining their own data mart separate from operational systems. Legacy systems that are not integrated with newer cloud applications.

**Why AI fails without solving this:** AI and machine learning models thrive on large, diverse, high-quality data. Silos reduce AI's access to relevant datasets, directly limiting its performance. An algorithm trained on one department's narrow data may perform poorly or with bias when applied broadly.

Research shows that 74% of CX technology implementations fail due to organizational silos.

## 2. Poor Data Quality — The "Garbage In, AI Out" Problem

This is the silent killer. When asked what would most improve marketing performance, the top ranked answer from CMOs was improving data quality (30%), ahead of automating data workflows (22%) and improving data democratization (21%).

The financial impact is staggering: In 2024, data quality continues to pose a significant challenge, with companies losing an average of $15 million annually due to poor data quality. Only 12% of organizations report having data of sufficient quality and accessibility to support effective AI implementation. As a result, 64% of organizations now identify data quality as their top challenge—an increase from 50% in 2023.

**What this looks like in practice:**
- When data errors like duplicate data result in customers receiving multiple emails or inaccurate personalization, brand trust erodes. Clients and customers are less likely to engage when they feel as if they are just another number.
- It's common to find marketing departments with 26 or more systems supporting 18 or more taxonomies, each created at one point in a marketing department's history to support specific campaigns.

**The three dimensions CMOs say need the most work:**
Completeness (31%): ensuring all relevant data is collected and available. Consistency (26%): removing discrepancies between sources to create a single version of the truth. Uniqueness (16%): eliminating duplication and overlap to avoid misleading metrics, unnecessary costs, and fragmented customer histories.

According to global research from Treasure Data, while a majority of marketers say they have access to customer data, around one-fifth say that data isn't accurate or high-quality. This poor-quality data resulted in inaccurate targeting (30%), lost customers (29%), lost leads (28%), reduced productivity (27%) and wasted marketing spend (28%).

## 3. Broken Identity Resolution — The "Who Is This Customer?" Problem

This is the technical challenge that most marketing teams underestimate. Despite the hype, the "single view of the customer" is usually an empty rallying cry as opposed to a day-to-day reality. This is because gathering all the data about your customers and merging it into a single record is still a largely unsolved challenge.

**Why this matters:**
Most marketers struggle with fragmented data and anonymous website visitors that prevent them from connecting insights about customer behaviors and preferences. This results in inconsistent, frustrating experiences for customers as they engage across different touchpoints.

**The scale of the challenge:** The average household has twenty-one connected devices in thirteen device type categories, and 96% of the world's digital consumers use a mobile device to connect to the internet.

Without customer identity resolution, each interaction might create a separate profile for that customer in your database. Your system might believe social media Robert to be an entirely different person than brick-and-mortar Robert. You might miss the opportunity to recognize him as a loyal customer and tailor your marketing efforts accordingly.

**The downstream effects:**
Personalization gaps: Without a unified view, personalization becomes generic and fails to resonate with customers. Missed opportunities for loyalty: This fragmentation prevents brands from understanding customer preferences, leading to lower satisfaction and loyalty. Inefficient marketing spend: Marketing teams waste resources targeting the same customer across multiple profiles or miss out on opportunities for precise engagement.

## The Data Engineer's Role in Solving All Three

This brings us back to your original question about why data engineers are the critical foundation. These three problems—silos, quality, and identity—are all fundamentally **data engineering problems**, not MarTech problems or AI problems.

Behind the impact wasn't a flashy new AI tool, but clean, accessible data threaded across the stack. For business leaders looking to unlock the true value of AI in digital experience, the message is clear: treat AI as an accelerator, not a workaround. No algorithm, no matter how advanced, can deliver on its promise without integrated, high-quality data as its foundation.

The MarTech tools and AI are the visible layer—but the data engineering work underneath is what determines whether any of it actually works.
