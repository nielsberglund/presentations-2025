Q: What advice would you give to teams looking to unify their MarTech, AI, and data strategies?

I'll research current best practices and expert guidance on unifying MarTech, AI, and data strategies.Based on my research, here's comprehensive advice for teams looking to unify their MarTech, AI, and data strategies:

## The Core Challenge

68% of respondents cite data silos as their top concern—up 7% from the previous year. Meanwhile, CMOs named unclear ownership and limited access to data and tools as the top barrier to delivering their strategy. And the cost of delay is real: 63% of CMOs say they're missing opportunities because they can't make decisions fast enough.

The paradox is clear: while organizations race to adopt generative AI and automation, their disconnected data initiatives are creating new silos rather than breaking them down.

## Seven Foundational Principles

### 1. Start with Data, Not Technology

AI alone isn't enough. The foundation of any AI-driven martech stack is data—how it's collected, cleaned, and connected. "Garbage in, garbage out," warns Sara Faatz. Without quality data, AI efforts will fall flat.

At Expedia Group, Vega argued that perfect data is a myth but, "we should be able to get to a level of good enough." Vega stressed the need for data about our data—metadata, tagging and a semantic layer that AI (and marketers) can use without hand-built connections.

### 2. Recognise That Silos Are a Leadership Problem

Silos are a leadership failure, Franz argued. Customer-centric organizations design for collaboration and data-sharing from the top down.

To manage these risks, organizations need to establish governance frameworks—with board-level oversight—that set clear rules for data integration (what connects and what stays siloed) and decision-making protocols (where AI ends and human judgment begins).

### 3. Build Cross-Functional Collaboration Into the Process

The evaluation process is becoming more rigorous, with cross-functional teams from IT, finance, and marketing collaborating to ensure new solutions deliver interoperability, measurable ROI, and long-term strategic value.

CEOs can take five steps to tap AI's full value: Champion the CMO. Without support from the top, CMOs won't have the political capital to drive cross-functional change. Prioritize having the CFO, the CIO, and the CMO work as one team, to ensure that AI efforts are customer‑centric and link directly to business outcomes.

### 4. Embrace Composable Architecture Over Monolithic Suites

The gravitational center of MarTech stacks is shifting away from rigid, all-in-one suites toward flexible, customer-centric platforms such as CRMs, MAPs, and cloud data warehouses. This trend enables brands to integrate best-in-class solutions and adapt quickly to changing requirements.

However, be realistic: many assume composable means plug-and-play. The reality is more nuanced. While integration platforms and APIs have made connections easier than ever, composable still requires more planning and expertise than most organizations expect.

### 5. Conduct Regular Stack Audits

Despite spending on Martech increasing significantly—from $15.3 billion in 2020 to $23.6 billion in 2023—utilization rates have continued to decline, with businesses using only 33% of their Martech capabilities in 2023, compared to 58% in 2020.

Recent surveys indicate that a majority of marketers have conducted stack audits in the past year, aiming to reduce redundancy, simplify user experiences, and cut integration costs.

### 6. Frame It as Growth, Not Technology

Don't just sell "customer experience" to leadership; frame it as growth. Growth resonates in the C-suite, even if the levers are CX-focused.

To boost martech ROI, CMOs should conduct regular audits, optimize underused tools and align the stack with business capabilities. High-performing organizations use capability-driven measurement and build composable martech stacks that support AI integration and long-term flexibility.

### 7. Maintain Human Oversight

Technical integration is a key factor, but it represents just one piece of the puzzle. True AI unification and success requires human oversight into AI-enabled workflows to maintain alignment with brand values, strategic objectives and regulatory standards.

## Practical Steps to Get Started

**Step 1: Define outcomes first**
The first step is to define clear outcomes, such as improved conversion rates or faster experiment cycles. The next step is to audit the current stack to identify redundant tools and free up budget.

**Step 2: Start with your data foundation**
Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a composable martech stack. Start by standing up your data foundation and composing a few key journeys or use cases. Measure your results, gather feedback and iterate from there.

**Step 3: Establish a minimum viable integration**
Establish a minimum viable integration of identifiers and events across systems. Enforce quality at collection to prevent expensive cleanup later. Apply AI to unstructured inputs like transcripts or reviews for weekly CX insights.

**Step 4: Create cross-functional alignment**
Create a cross-journey huddle where marketing, product and support align on shared CX scorecards and experiments.

**Step 5: Verify vendors rigorously**
Require vendors to demonstrate—not just describe—their value. Focus on outcomes, not features. Request user references and integration capabilities. Conduct competitive proofs of concept (POCs). Prioritize composability—modular, API-friendly tools that reduce lock-in.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Over-reliance on technology without process change:**
Technology alone won't deliver unforgettable CX—people and process must lead.

**Underestimating the need for specialist skills:**
"I don't see a world where a marketer can be completely non-technical anymore," notes Greg Brunk.

**Neglecting data governance:**
Delval summarized the balance: centralize governance, not necessarily tools. Duplicates plague every enterprise. Jackson called them "a very real problem" that CRMs and MAPs can't fix alone.

**Ignoring consent by design:**
"Collect consent alongside the data point—understand what you're allowed to do with it now and later." Jackson, speaking as a consumer, was blunt: "Don't text my cell while I'm at soccer practice." If marketers want deeper access, they must provide reciprocal value.

## The Strategic Questions to Ask

What should our multiyear martech roadmap look like, and how can marketing and IT collaborate to achieve it? Which tools are redundant or underperforming, and how can we streamline the stack? How will new technologies support customer journey orchestration? Where can we consolidate and integrate across teams for greater efficiency?

## The Bottom Line

Rather than a unified picture of the consumer journey, many CMOs find themselves struggling to piece together disparate data points. Brands that master the art of data management now will be rewarded with sophisticated insights that drive engagement and relevance. Those that don't risk falling behind, unable to justify their investments in expensive analytics systems and personnel.

The future of MarTech lies not in amassing tools but in architecting smart, agile systems—powered by AI, guided by human insight, and always centered on the customer.
