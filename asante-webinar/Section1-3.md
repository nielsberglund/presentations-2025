Q: Once a company has clean and unified data, how does AI transform that into personalisation the end-user can actually experience
---
Excellent question—this is where the magic happens for the customer. Let me research how AI actually operationalizes that clean data into experiences people can feel.This is where the entire MarTech investment comes to life. Once you have that clean, unified data foundation, AI acts as the "brain" that transforms static customer profiles into dynamic, real-time experiences. Let me walk you through the mechanics.

## The Core Transformation: From Data to Decision to Experience

The next best experience capability uses data and AI to answer the question "What does this customer need most in this moment?" It then delivers a seamless, personalized, and satisfying customer experience that builds loyalty and customer lifetime value.

Think of it as three connected layers:

**Layer 1: Understanding** — AI analyzes the unified customer profile
**Layer 2: Deciding** — AI determines the optimal action in real-time
**Layer 3: Executing** — The experience is delivered across touchpoints

## How AI Actually "Thinks" About Each Customer

AI personalization uses a customer's demographic and past behavioral data—such as browsing and purchasing history, as well as social media interactions—to learn about the specific needs and preferences of that individual. Using this insight, the technology can predict what they may be interested in, where they want to engage with your brand, and what the next best customer touchpoint would be in their ideal shopping journey.

The key shift from traditional marketing is this: Modern MarTech and traditional personalization approaches—audience segmentation and rules-based journeys—have helped marketers deliver personalized experiences, but they come with trade-offs: more personalization requires more rules, more journeys, or higher marketing agency fees.

AI changes that equation entirely.

## What the Customer Actually Experiences

### 1. Real-Time Product Recommendations

Using the insights gleaned from the data analysis, an AI-powered recommendation engine generates personalized suggestions, such as product suggestions that align with past purchases and browsing history, content recommendations for blog posts, articles, and videos that might interest them, and personalized offers on products that are aligned with their interests and previous purchasing behavior.

The scale is significant: An estimated 35% of Amazon's e-commerce revenue comes from its AI-driven product recommendation engine. These recommendations not only increase basket size and cross-sell but also enhance the shopping experience by surfacing relevant products from a catalog of millions.

### 2. Dynamic Content That Adapts in Real-Time

Hyper-personalization advances the practice of personalization by using real-time data and AI to deliver highly customized experiences. This can include real-time product recommendations, dynamic website content that responds to user navigation, and personalized marketing campaigns that adapt based on user interactions.

One of the most powerful aspects of AI tools is the ability to adapt in real time. This means learning from responses: if a customer shows interest in a certain recommendation by clicking on a product link, the system notes that activity and adjusts its future suggestions. As their preferences and behaviors change, the AI system adapts, ensuring that recommendations remain relevant.

### 3. Intelligent Channel Selection

Email might work for one person, while another prefers SMS. AI decisioning figures that out for you. By analyzing how each person interacts with different channels, it automatically chooses the one most likely to deliver results.

AI decisioning can help lifecycle marketers create 1:1 personalization by finding the best channel, time of day, day of the week, frequency, message, creative—or indeed any other dimension a marketer wishes to test—simultaneously.

### 4. Proactive Service Before Problems Occur

Imagine your company had an AI-powered engine that could detect when a customer needs help—before they even realize it. And was able to coordinate and sequence customer touchpoints while personalizing communications to get the right message to the customer in the right way.

## The "Next Best Experience" Framework

McKinsey's research shows this approach delivers measurable results: The AI-powered next best experience capability can enhance customer satisfaction by 15 to 20 percent, increase revenue by 5 to 8 percent, and reduce the cost to serve by 20 to 30 percent.

Here's how it works in practice:

A customer flagged as high-churn risk might be automatically removed from all promotional campaigns and instead added to a retention journey that involves loyalty offers or service improvements. Conversely, a customer with low-churn risk but high-upsell probability may receive a proactive upgrade message.

A practical example: A telecommunications company in Europe decided to stop all outbound campaigns to customers who had open complaints, ongoing care journeys, or a high propensity to call regarding service-related topics. This simple act of ensuring that care activities took place prior to any outbound marketing had a positive effect: It drove the company's net promoter score (NPS) to the same level as the market leader's NPS and improved both cross-sell and churn rates.

## Generative AI Adds the Creative Layer

Gen AI creates personalized content that powers the customer experience. Large language models enable dynamic message generation, which includes contextual references, such as recent transactions, service interactions, or usage trends. These messages can vary in tone and detail depending on customer preferences and can be tailored to the delivery channel.

By understanding nuances of individual preferences and context, generative AI can dynamically create personalized content like messaging, images, videos, and digital experiences. This level of personalization heightens customer engagement, optimizes marketing campaigns, and boosts revenue across the entire customer lifecycle.

## A Real Customer Journey Example

Let me paint a picture of what this looks like in practice:

As a customer searches for gifts and converses with AI-powered chatbots on ecommerce platforms, they're presented with a curated list of age-appropriate, relevant gift ideas that are updated practically in real time. This eliminates their need to sift through irrelevant options as they browse, which improves their feelings about the experience.

A cosmetics brand example: Yves Rocher faced the challenge of providing personalized product recommendations to returning customers and first-time visitors. Bloomreach Engagement helped through real-time personalized product recommendations. This solution automatically created anonymous user profiles as visitors interacted with products, enabling immediate personalization during their sessions. As a result, Yves Rocher experienced a remarkable 17.5x increase in clicks on recommended items within one minute and an 11x increase in purchase rates for these products.

## The Shift from Rules to Learning

This is the key conceptual shift for your webinar audience to understand:

For a long time, lifecycle marketing has revolved around customer journeys: marketers build a flow, map out a bunch of if/then rules, and cross fingers that people follow it the way you planned. But the reality is, most customers don't move through funnels in a straight line. They bounce around, come in hot, go cold, and then pop back up again weeks later. Rule-based journeys weren't built for that kind of behavior.

That's where AI decisioning comes in. Instead of sticking people on a track, AI decision-making happens in real time, reacting to what a customer is doing right now and choosing the best action in that moment. It's not guessing based on personas or following a fixed script. It's constantly evaluating and adapting, so your marketing actually keeps up with your customer.

## The Business Impact

According to research from McKinsey, fast-growing organizations gain 40% more revenue from hyper-personalization when compared to slower-growing competitors. This is because they're using the intelligence gained from their customer data to know how to fulfill a specific customer need at a specific moment.

Research from Harvard Business Review indicates that personalized user experiences can generate five to eight times the return on marketing spend. This success is evident in platforms like Netflix, where more than 80% of viewing time stems from tailored recommendations.

## Bringing It Full Circle

This is why your earlier question about data engineering matters so much. AI decisioning brings intelligence to every customer interaction. It learns continuously from outcomes and scales true 1:1 personalization in ways that weren't previously possible.

But none of this works without clean, unified data feeding it. The AI is only as good as the foundation it's built on—which brings us back to the data engineer as the unsung hero of the entire MarTech stack.
