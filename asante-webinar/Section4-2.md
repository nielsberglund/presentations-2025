## The Trust Paradox: AI Creates Both Opportunity and Risk

An Adobe study reveals that 44% of consumers feel frustrated when brands fail to deliver personalized experiences, while 70% are uneasy about how their data is collected and used.

This is the central tension every company must navigate: customers want personalization but distrust how you get there.

Just 20% of surveyed respondents say tech providers are "very clear" about what data they collect or how it's used, and only 20% say it's "very easy" to control what's collected about them.

Fewer than half (48%) believe that the benefits they get from online services outweigh their privacy concerns—a steep drop from 58% in 2024 and the lowest level since we began surveying this sentiment in 2019.

## The Six Priority Areas Companies Must Address

### 1. Data Privacy and Consent: The Non-Negotiable Foundation

"Privacy is no longer a checkbox; it's a strategic business imperative," Hutchins stated. "Customers want to know that their data is being handled responsibly, and it's being handled respectfully."

**The consumer expectation is clear:**

The majority of respondents (73% in the UK, 81% in the US and 82% in Australia) criticized companies for collecting too much of their personal or financial data. And 9 out of 10 consumers are concerned that AI will impact how companies keep customer data secure.

Consumers (70% in the UK, 81% in the US, and 83% in Australia) are severely concerned with the unrestricted or unpoliced use of AI with their data, with the vast majority demanding greater transparency and regulation.

**What this means practically:**

Data privacy concerns revolve around how customer information is collected, stored, and used by AI systems. Since AI-powered bots rely on large amounts of data to function effectively—such as customer queries, purchase history, or personal details—mishandling or misusing this data can lead to breaches, misuse, or regulatory violations.

Limiting data collection to only what's necessary, encrypting sensitive information, and complying with privacy laws like GDPR or CCPA are critical steps. By safeguarding data, companies reassure customers that their personal information is secure and will not be misused.

### 2. Algorithmic Bias: The Hidden Discrimination Risk

This is where companies face the greatest reputational and legal exposure.

Ethical considerations go beyond compliance. AI systems can unintentionally reinforce biases present in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or exclusionary outcomes. For instance, biased algorithms in credit scoring or targeted advertising can inadvertently disadvantage certain demographics.

**Real-world examples that should concern every CX leader:**

For example, imagine a financial services chatbot trained on historical customer interactions. If the data primarily reflects interactions with high-income customers, the AI might learn to prioritize their needs, potentially offering them quicker response times or more personalized assistance compared to low-income customers. This not only creates an unfair service experience but also risks alienating a significant portion of the customer base and damaging the company's reputation.

Apple's credit card algorithm (managed by Goldman Sachs) faced scrutiny after it reportedly offered significantly lower credit limits to women compared to their male spouses, even when women had higher credit scores and incomes. Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson highlighted that he received a credit limit 20 times higher than his wife's, despite her higher credit score and shared financial accounts.

ProPublica revealed significant age bias in Facebook's targeted job advertising. Employers were able to exclude older workers from viewing job listings by restricting ad visibility to younger age groups, primarily individuals under 40. This targeting prevented older adults from accessing opportunities, violating anti-discrimination laws like the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). Companies such as Verizon and Amazon faced legal scrutiny for using this feature.

**How bias manifests in CX specifically:**

Customer service chatbots may provide consistent and unbiased support—or they may not. AI algorithms may recommend products fairly—or they may not. Loan approvals should be based on impartial financial factors. Healthcare diagnoses and treatment recommendations should be equitable.

AI-driven customer service platforms, like chatbots, may offer poorer service to certain demographics, leading to dissatisfaction and loss of business.

### 3. Transparency: Tell Customers When They're Interacting with AI

This is rapidly becoming a baseline expectation:

Over 80% of consumers believe that AI-created material – including text, images and video – should be clearly labelled, while 62% say that such transparency would increase their trust in a brand.

84% would have more trust in AI that demonstrates explainability – that is, AI which seeks to be transparent and understandable to humans.

Transparency involves openly communicating how an AI system works, including what data it uses, how decisions are made, and when customers are interacting with AI instead of a human. Many users feel frustrated when they realize that they are speaking with a chatbot during critical customer service interactions without being informed.

**The business case for disclosure is compelling:**

AI-generated ads with noticed disclosures significantly boosted brand perceptions and provided a 47 per cent lift in ad appeal, a 73 per cent lift in ad trustworthiness, and a 96 per cent lift in overall trust for the company.

### 4. Human Oversight: The AI-Human Handoff Problem

Consumers are clear about wanting humans in the loop:

While 71% of consumers recognize the benefits of AI in their day-to-day life, 82% of those who care about AI say they would have more trust if humans were involved in AI development.

When asked what would increase their willingness to use personal AI assistants, consumers across all regions consistently highlighted three top priorities: data security and privacy (57%), transparency around how decisions are made (48%), and the availability of human oversight or support (46%).

**The "doom loop" problem:**

Many consumers have experienced frustration with endless chatbot feedback loops (dubbed "doom loops" in industries like banking and finance where they're prevalent), long wait times in contact centers with fewer staff, and a lack of consistency and accurate data capture across customer service channels. This led to a troubling trend: many customers using self-service tools, especially younger generations who prefer them, opted to simply disengage altogether.

When AI systems make mistakes or lead to undesirable outcomes, customers need clarity on who is responsible. Businesses should define roles and responsibilities for managing AI-driven issues, ensuring that customers can escalate concerns to human agents when needed.

### 5. Explainability: Can You Explain Why the AI Made That Decision?

AI models, especially deep learning models with opaque algorithms, are often "black boxes," making it difficult to explain how they make decisions.

This matters because regulations increasingly require it:

Article 22 of GDPR grants individuals the right to "not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing," including profiling, that has a legal effect or is similarly significant. This clause also requires "meaningful information about the logic involved" and human oversight.

In July 2025, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) finalized new CCPA regulations that apply to automated decision-making technology. Businesses that use AI to engage with customers must implement appropriate consent management, data minimization, and some level of explainability for automated decisions, and prepare for audits and consumer data-subject requests.

### 6. Regulatory Compliance: The Legal Framework is Solidifying

The regulatory landscape is maturing rapidly:

**EU AI Act:**

The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is the first comprehensive legal framework on AI globally, which creates harmonized requirements to ensure AI safety, protect fundamental rights, and inspire trust. The Act is based on a risk-based approach, creating four risk classes for AI systems including unacceptable risk (AI uses that are banned outright), and high risk (AI used in critical infrastructure, law enforcement, education, employment, and essential private services, subject to strict requirements on risk management, bias prevention, transparency, documentation, human oversight).

**US Enforcement:**

Legal liabilities from AI bias are increasing as discrimination lawsuits target algorithmic decision-making. Companies face potential class-action lawsuits, regulatory fines, and compliance costs that can reach tens of millions of dollars. The FTC's 2024 Civil Rights Report warned that AI bias violations could trigger significant enforcement actions.

South Korea enacted the comprehensive AI Framework Act effective January 2026, mandating fairness and non-discrimination across all AI systems, especially high-impact sectors like healthcare and public services. Requires transparency measures, including labeling AI-generated content. Enforces with administrative fines up to about $21,000 USD.

## The Business Consequences of Getting This Wrong

**Reputational damage:**

Decreased customer trust directly impacts market share and revenue growth. When AI systems treat customers unfairly, affected communities may boycott products or services, while potential customers question the company's values and reliability.

Companies may suffer reputational damage if biases in their AI tools become public, potentially losing customer trust and market share.

**Legal exposure:**

On May 16, 2025, Judge Rita Lin denied Workday's motion to dismiss and granted preliminary collective‑action certification for a lawsuit alleging that Workday's AI-based applicant screening system discriminated against applicants based on age, race, and disability, allowing the case to proceed on behalf of applicants 40 and older denied recommendations since September 2020.

Disparate impact: Algorithms causing disproportionate rejection of protected groups may violate federal law even absent intent. No "Software Exception" rule: Court refused to distinguish between human and AI decision-makers to avoid undermining anti-discrimination laws.

**Customer abandonment:**

Dynamic pricing frustrations rose from 14% to 28% year-over-year, reflecting broader discontent with opaque algorithmic practices.

## What Consumers Actually Want: The Trust Framework

Respondents are particularly sceptical about sharing personal data – two-thirds (67%) would only do so if strong privacy protections are in place.

According to Salesforce, 92% of consumers are more likely to trust brands that clearly explain how their data is used.

98% of consumers agree that 'authentic' images and videos are pivotal in establishing trust.

"While our report found that younger generations are more accepting of AI as consumers, everyone expects responsible and ethical use. Companies can build customer trust while deploying this technology by making a public commitment, built on a robust internal program, on how they will build, deploy and use AI."

## Practical Implementation: The Ethical AI Checklist for CX

Based on the research, here's what companies should prioritize:

### Before Deployment

Businesses must prioritize ethical AI practices, including rigorous bias testing, explainable AI frameworks, and human oversight to ensure decisions align with fairness principles.

Fairness-by-design: This proactive approach integrates fairness considerations into the AI development lifecycle from the beginning, rather than as an afterthought. It includes developing fair algorithms and conducting impact assessments during the design phase.

Teams that anticipate these requirements upfront and make them a part of design from the beginning can avoid onerous retrofits later and build stronger trust with customers.

### During Operation

Auditing and transparency: Human oversight is incorporated into processes to audit AI-generated decisions for bias and fairness. Developers can also provide transparency into how AI systems arrive at conclusions and decide how much weight to give those results.

Audit Regularly: Periodically assess compliance with data privacy laws and organizational policies. Address any gaps or vulnerabilities promptly.

### Ongoing Governance

A PwC survey reveals that 79% of CEOs believe ethical AI will be crucial to maintaining customer trust over the next five years. Companies are increasingly adopting guidelines to ensure that AI systems are fair, transparent, and accountable.

The most successful bias-free AI systems in 2025 treat fairness as a measurable product feature with specific KPIs, dedicated resources, and clear success metrics rather than vague aspirational goals.

## The Bottom Line: Ethics as Competitive Advantage

Balancing personalized marketing with data privacy is no longer optional—it's a mandate for sustainable business growth. By embracing privacy-by-design principles, leveraging privacy-preserving AI technologies, and maintaining transparent communication, businesses can deliver tailored experiences without eroding trust. The mantra for success is clear: personalization with protection.

Future developments in AI will likely include enhanced frameworks for ethical AI, incorporating principles such as fairness, accountability, and transparency into the design and deployment of personalization technologies. Responsible personalization will also emphasize user control and autonomy, allowing customers to manage their personalization preferences and opt-out of certain features if desired.
