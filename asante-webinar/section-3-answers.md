Q: Many organisations struggle not with data collection, but with data quality. What role does data engineering play in fixing this?

A: This is exactly the right question—and it's where so many AI and personalization initiatives fail. ßIn most organisations, the problem isn’t collecting data, it’s that bad data has been normalised—costing on average **$12.9M a year per company**, wasting about **21% of media spend**, and forcing data teams to spend **60% of their time just cleaning up mess** instead of creating value. 

Data engineering fixes this by baking quality into the pipeline: early validation (the 1:10:100 rule), automated cleansing and standardisation, real-time monitoring and anomaly detection, self-healing pipelines, and increasingly AI-powered data quality tools that spot and correct issues at scale. 

In short, data engineers become the quality gatekeepers—turning data quality from a reactive firefight into a continuous, automated process so every AI model, personalization engine, and dashboard runs on solid ground instead of sand.

Q: What does a strong data foundation look like for companies wanting to deliver advanced personalization?

A: A strong data foundation for advanced personalization is built on a unified cloud data architecture plus a CDP that stitches together all customer touchpoints into real-time, AI-ready 360° profiles—breaking silos and becoming the single source of truth for marketing, product, and CX. 

It combines first-party data strategy, tight data quality and governance (in a world where ~45% of CRM data is inaccurate), real-time streaming, robust APIs/reverse ETL, and privacy-by-design so brands can safely activate insights everywhere. The leaders are the ones who move from static, batch data to continuously verified, streaming data operations that their AI and MarTech can trust.

Q: How should businesses think about integrating data from multiple platforms into one coherent customer view?

A: To get to a coherent customer view, you don’t start with tools, you start with strategy: decide the outcomes you want, break down data silos (which 68% of orgs now cite as their top concern), and invest in identity resolution that blends deterministic and probabilistic matching so you can confidently stitch behaviour across channels. 

Then you build the right architecture for you—integrated, composable, or hybrid CDP—around five pillars: robust integrations, an identity engine, a unified customer database, strong governance, and activation/analytics, following a phased roadmap that can show value in as little as 6–8 weeks. 

The payoff is real: unified data can drive up to 8.9% more sales and 30–50% efficiency gains, and it’s the difference between being one of the 34% of companies that actually deliver seamless omnichannel experiences and the rest who only talk about it.
