## Abstract for Option 2:

C# + MCP + Azure AI: Building Conversational Enterprise Applications That Actually Work

*Stop Building MCP Servers, Start Using Them in Production*

---

Enough with the "Hello World" MCP server tutorials. It's time to build something that actually ships.

In this code-intensive session, we'll stop talking about (well, we'll mention it a little bit) the Model Context Protocol and start using it. You'll learn how to integrate any MCP server (here, Microsoft's MSSQL MCP Server) into a real web application, complete with Azure AI, to build a conversational event management system that handles real business logic.

What You'll Build:
- A web application with a chat interface powered by Azure AI
- Natural language database operations that turn "Add speaker Elena Petrova presenting on AI Ethics" into working SQL
- Smart attendee registration handling capacity constraints, scheduling conflicts, and data validation
- Post-event analytics and reporting—generated through conversation

What You'll Learn:
- The architecture patterns for connecting C# applications to MCP servers
- How to use Azure AI as the orchestration layer between your UI and MCP endpoints
- Prompt engineering strategies that work in production (not just demos)

We'll write C# code that makes an effortless data experience possible for event managers. This isn't theory; it's the actual implementation patterns you'll need to integrate MCP into your enterprise applications tomorrow.

Warning: This session is 90% live coding, so come prepared with questions.

Level: Intermediate to Advanced  
Technologies: C#, ASP.NET Core, Azure AI Foundry, MCP, SQL Server  
Prerequisites: Familiarity with C# and REST APIs helpful  
Audience: .NET developers ready to ship AI-powered features
