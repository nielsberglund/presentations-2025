# C# + MCP + Azure AI

This is the code for the **C# + MCP + Azure AI** talk at the .NET Conf events in Cape Town and Johannesburg.

## Things to Keep in Mind

* Read the `README.md` file in the MssqlMcp folder.
* Each of the projects read the MCP configuration from the `mcp-mac.json` and `mcp-win.json` files respectively.
* You need to edit those files to match the path to your MCP server as well as the database details.
