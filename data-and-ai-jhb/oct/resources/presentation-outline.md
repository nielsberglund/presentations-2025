*Checkpoint 1: Set Up Application Structure*
- Choose simple stack (e.g., HTML/JavaScript, or Python Flask, or React - whatever you're comfortable demoing)
- Show the basic file structure
- "Aha moment": "Just a regular web app - nothing AI-specific yet"

*Checkpoint 2: Install Required Libraries*
- Add Azure AI SDK/library
- Show package installation
- Quick explanation of what it does

*Checkpoint 3: Configure Connection*
- Add endpoint and keys from Azure
- Show environment variables/config
- Emphasize security best practices
- "Aha moment": "This is how our app knows where to find our agent"

*Checkpoint 4: Create the Agent Call*
- Write code to call the agent
- Show request structure
- Show response handling
- Keep it simple - 10-20 lines of code max
- "Aha moment": "That's it? Just one API call?"

*Checkpoint 5: Build the UI*
- Create simple input/output interface
- Wire up the agent call to UI
- Make it visually clean but simple
- "Aha moment": "Now users can talk to our AI through our app"

*Checkpoint 6: Live Demo!*
- Run the application
- Demonstrate with real inputs
- Show different use cases
- Invite audience to suggest prompts
- Deliberately try edge cases
- "Aha moment": "WE JUST BUILT AN AI-POWERED APP!"

## Presentation Tips & Notes

### Pre-Session Prep
- [ ] Have Azure AI Foundry project pre-created as backup
- [ ] Test internet connection
- [ ] Have code snippets ready in VS Code/editor
- [ ] Clear browser cache/history for clean demo
- [ ] Increase font size for code visibility
- [ ] Test microphone and screen sharing
- [ ] Have backup slides with screenshots in case of live demo failure

### During Session
- **Timing checkpoints:**
  - 5 min: Should be on Slide 4
  - 15 min: Should be starting Live Coding Part 1
  - 30 min: Should be starting Live Coding Part 2
  - 50 min: Should be on wrap-up slides

- **Energy points:**
  - Start with enthusiasm
  - Celebrate each "aha moment"
  - Keep narrating what you're doing
  - Pause for questions at natural breaks
  - Stay calm if something breaks (it happens!)

- **Audience engagement:**
  - Ask "How many have tried AI tools before?"
  - Ask for prompt suggestions during demo
  - Encourage questions throughout
  - Make eye contact (not just at screen)

### Common Questions to Prepare For
1. "How much does this cost?"
2. "Can this work with my own data?"
3. "How do I keep it secure?"
4. "What if the AI gives wrong answers?"
5. "Can I use this in production?"
6. "What models are available?"
7. "How do I handle rate limits?"
8. "Can I customize the model?"

- High contrast for visibility
- Large fonts (minimum 24pt for body text)
- Minimal text per slide (max 5-7 bullets)
- Use visuals/diagrams over text where possible
- Consistent color scheme matching Microsoft/Azure branding

### Code Display
- Dark theme for code (easier on eyes)
- Syntax highlighting
- Font size: minimum 18pt for code
- Highlight key lines
- Keep code snippets short (< 15 lines per slide)

### Diagrams
- Simple, clean architecture diagrams
- Use icons/visuals
- Clear arrows showing flow
- Label everything clearly
- Use Azure official icons where possible

## Success Metrics

You'll know this session worked if:
- Audience leaves saying "I can do this"
- Questions are about next steps, not basics
- People are excited to try it themselves
- You get requests for the code/resources
- Attendees stay after for follow-up questions

Remember: The goal is not to show everything Azure AI Foundry can do, but to make ONE person feel confident enough to build their first agent!
