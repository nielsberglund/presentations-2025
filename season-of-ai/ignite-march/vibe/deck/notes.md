When I was Young
*IntelliSense was a great step forward, but we still had to write the code

* Reminisce briefly on how IntelliSense changed developer productivity.
* Explain how we shifted from simple autocomplete to full-context generation.
* Set up the transition to vibe coding: “What if the IDE understood what you wanted—and just built it for you?”

The Rise of LLMs
*We have come to the point where multiple LLMs can collaborate

What is Vibe Coding
* Andrey Karpathy: Director of AI at Tesla, co-founder of OpenAI
* You are shifting from thinking about syntaxt, to think about systems.
* You’re not typing less because you're lazy… you're typing less because you're vibing.

The Vibe Workflow
* This is coding as a conversation
* Show how AI turns devs into directors. The output is code, but the input is vibes.
* Lead in to how so far you have written instructions, what if you can talk - SuperWhisper

Tools of the Trade
* The tools are evolving, but the mindset is the real game-changer.

* Are we still “coding” or “orchestrating”?
* You’re a systems thinker, not a syntax wrangler
*Codebases might outgrow your mental model—and that’s okay

The code grows beyond my usual comprehension... but it works

Takeaway Vibes
* You just watched me build more in 60 minutes than I used to in a day. That’s the future
