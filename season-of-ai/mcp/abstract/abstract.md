Title: Inside the Black Box: How MCP Servers Turn Conversations Into Database Operations
Tagline: *The Architecture Behind AI-Powered Enterprise Integration*

Details: 

Stop reading about MCP—start seeing how it actually works.

This code-heavy session demystifies the Model Context Protocol through live inspection and debugging. Using the MSSQL MCP Server as our example, we'll follow an event management scenario to trace the complete journey: from natural language prompts, through AI orchestration and tool invocation, to actual system execution and back.

You'll see tool discovery, multi-step workflows, error handling, and state management—not on slides, but in debuggers and protocol inspectors. Learn the architectural patterns that apply to any MCP server and any enterprise AI integration.

Minimal slides. Maximum terminal windows. The protocol—demystified through code.
