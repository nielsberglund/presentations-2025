In traditional software, every new integration (database, CRM, API, storage, external tool) required a custom connector: if you had N tools and M AI‑driven applications, you faced N × M work. That becomes unmanageable as systems scale.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) changes that by acting like a universal “USB‑C port” for AI apps — a standard, open-source protocol that lets large language models (LLMs) connect to any data source or tool with a single integration. Instead of building many bespoke connectors, you build once. Each LLM or AI agent simply implements MCP and gains access to all connected services — data stores, external APIs, document repos, CRMs, you name it.
