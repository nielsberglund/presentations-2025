Hi, I’m Niels, an Event Manager for Data & AI Community Day Durban. My expertise is crafting perfect events, but when it comes to database tech, I’m no wizard. However, I will be providing you with all the necessary information related to the event such as speakers, events, registration, session, and room information.

I need to track speakers including their name, what topic they will present, and their contact email.

Hi, I’m Niels, an Event Manager for Data & AI Community Day Durban. My expertise is crafting perfect events, but when it comes to database tech, I’m no wizard. However, I will be providing you with all the necessary information related to the event such as speakers, events, registration, session, and room information. Can you look in the database and see what tables are available for me to use to manage my event?
-------------------
I also need to manage sessions with details like the session’s title, who the speaker is, the date and time, the room, and how many attendees the speakers expect (expected registrations). Expected registration cannot exceed allotted room capacity. Lastly, I want to manage attendee registrations, tracking attendees by their name and email, and linking them to the sessions they sign up for.
-------------------
I have the following information on the rooms that are available, and their maximum capacity allowed:

Main Hall with a max capacity 350 attendees

Room A max capacity 100 attendees

Room B max capacity 80 attendees

Room C max capacity of 150 attendees

Ball Room max capacity 200 attendees
------------------
Can you add the following speakers and sessions and show me the title, speaker name, and room for all sessions once added?

------------------
I think I made a mistake, looks like we need to increase the capacity of the ‘Keynote on AI Ethics’ session by 50 additional attendees is it still possible? Also, Ms. Sophia Lee’s requested that her topic has changed to ‘Advanced Analytics with Fabric’.
--------------------
Great thank you! I need to reach out to one of our speakers Tom, how do I contact him?
---------------------
